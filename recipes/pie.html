    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8 medium apples (peeled, cored, and sliced)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 package of pre-made pie crusts (or homemade crust)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter (optional, for dotting)</li>
        <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and flour. Mix well to coat the apples evenly.</li>
        <li>Roll out one pie crust and place it into a 9-inch pie dish. Trim the edges if necessary.</li>
        <li>Pour the apple mixture into the pie crust, spreading it out evenly. Dot the filling with small pieces of butter if desired.</li>
        <li>Roll out the second pie crust and place it over the apples. You can create a lattice design or simply cover the pie and cut slits in the top to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Seal the edges of the pie crusts together and crimp them with a fork or your fingers.</li>
        <li>Beat the egg in a small bowl and brush it over the top crust to give it a golden finish.</li>
        <li>Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pie from the oven and let it cool for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
