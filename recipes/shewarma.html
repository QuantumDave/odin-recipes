    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food made with marinated meat (usually chicken, beef, or lamb) that is slow-cooked on a vertical rotisserie. 
        The meat is thinly sliced and served in a warm pita or flatbread, along with fresh vegetables, pickles, and a creamy garlic sauce or tahini.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe simplifies the process by using a stovetop or grill to cook the marinated meat, making it easy to recreate this flavorful dish at home.

        <li>4 pita breads or flatbreads</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>1 cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced cucumbers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pickles (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tahini sauce or garlic sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, paprika, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create the marinade.</li>
        <li>Add the thinly sliced chicken (or beef/lamb) to the marinade, ensuring it is fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight for best results).</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated meat and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fully cooked and slightly charred.</li>
        <li>Warm the pita bread or flatbreads in a skillet or microwave for a few seconds to make them pliable.</li>
        <li>Assemble the shawarma by placing a generous amount of cooked meat in the center of each pita bread.</li>
        <li>Top with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced cucumbers, and pickles (if using).</li>
        <li>Drizzle with tahini sauce or garlic sauce.</li>
        <li>Fold the pita bread around the filling, wrapping it tightly to hold everything together.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade shawarma!</li>
